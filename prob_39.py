If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides,
 {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.
 {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

Ecercise: 
    For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?


SOLUTION:
    This problem can be solved using the same technique as described in
    problem 9.
