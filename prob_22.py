Using names.txt text file containing over 5000 first names, begin by sorting
it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each
name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain
a name score.

For example,
 In alphabeticaly sorder list, COLIN
 - is 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53,
 - is the 938th name in the list. 
 COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
